## About Application
This Spring Boot application takes an OpenAPI (v3.x) spec in JSON, evaluates its structure and content against industry best practices, and provides a score for each criterion with clear, actionable feedback. This application uses Swagger parser.

Disclaimer: ekvit22 is my other account for university and I changed my github account in Intellij after I started creating this project so that's why the first 2 commits are done by that account.

## Scoring
### Scoring Criteria (each weighted; total = 100 points)

**Schema & Types (20 pts):** Use of proper data types; no freeâ€‘form objects without schema.

**Descriptions & Documentation (20 pts):** All paths, operations, parameters, request bodies, and responses include meaningful description fields.

**Paths & Operations (15 pts):** Consistent naming and CRUD conventions; no overlapping or redundant paths.

**Response Codes (15 pts):** Appropriate use of HTTP status codes; each operation defines expected success and error codes.

**Examples & Samples (10 pts):** Presence of request/response examples for major endpoints.

**Security (10 pts):** Defined and referenced security schemes where needed.

**Miscellaneous Best Practices (10 pts):** e.g., versioning, servers array, tags, components reuse.

## Setup

### Clone the GitHub Repository
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd <folder-name>
```
### Build the applicaiton
Keep in mind that this application starts on `http://localhost:8000`. If you would like to change that then change the port in `src/main/resources/application.properties`.
The application is configured using Maven, therefore we need to run maven:
```
mvn clean validate install
```
To start the application you need to run:
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
### API Platform
I personally used Postman while working on this project because I already have some experience with Postman, but you can use any API Platform. I'm gonna write Postman-specific instructions here because that's the platform I'm familiar with, but these instructions will still help you navigate other platforms. To run the application with Postman, write `http://localhost:8000/api/score` in the address bar. Choose POST request, then go to `Body` and choose `raw` and `JSON` for file types.
Input the OpenAPI spec in JSON text box to send the request.

## **API Endpoints**
### POST: /api/score
Sends the scorecard
**Example:**
Let's use one of the files I have added in the tests folder (just for this example): [https://github.com/f1re-keeper/API-Scoring-App/blob/master/src/test/resources/samples/1password.json] - OpenAPI spec for `1password.com/events/1.2.0`.
This is the resulting scorecard:
```
{
    "grade": "B",
    "result": {
        "score": 83.69047619047619,
        "ruleBreakdown": {
            "Schema & Types (20 pts)": 16.19047619047619,
            "Descriptions & Documentation (20 pts)": 20.0,
            "Response Codes (15 pts)": 15.0,
            "Security Schemes (10 pts)": 10.0,
            "Request/Response Examples (10 pts)": 0.0,
            "Paths & Operations (15 pts)": 15.0,
            "Miscellaneous Best Practices (10 pts)": 7.5
        },
        "feedback": "Component schema `AuditEventItems` is incomplete. Component schema `CursorCollection` is incomplete. Component schema `ItemUsageItems` is incomplete. Component schema `SignInAttemptItems` is incomplete. Some schemas are incomplete or missing. No examples provided in request/response bodies. Tags not found. "
    }
}
```
**Response for valid input:**
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```
**Response for invalid input:**
```
HTTP/1.1 400 BAD REQUEST
```

## Testing
You can see the tests in `src/test/java/org.example.theneoassignment`. These tests also use custom JSON files located in `src/test/resources/unit_tests` for Unit Tests that test each scoring criterion and `src/test/resources/samples` contain actual public OpenAPI sample specs. These public samples were taken from [https://github.com/APIs-guru/openapi-directory/tree/main]. Run the tests with:
```
mvn test
```
